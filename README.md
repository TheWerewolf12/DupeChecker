DupeChecker mod for hypixel skyblock

- there are 2 versions availabe for this mod: a standalone jar file, & a ChatTriggers module

**Note: because of current limitations, the standalone version may not work depending on your Java version.**

**ChatTriggers Module is recommended**

## How does it work?
While in-game type '**/dupecheck**'! Our mod will send a request to [our api](https://dupechecker.pythonanywhere.com/) to check if an item with the same uuid has already been registered by another user, it will then enter in chat its suspicions about the item.

[The API](https://dupechecker.pythonanywhere.com/) will also update it's database with YOUR items! This means that the more people using the mod, the more accurate our model will be!


## We encourage you to try & verify yourself.
